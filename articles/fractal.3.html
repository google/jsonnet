        The rest of this article gives simple methodologies for deploying and managing the fractal
        application by editing the Jsonnet configuration and then applying these changes.  In order
        to reproduce this case study there are a few pre-requisites:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A Linux or OSX system with GNU Make.
        </li>
        <li>
          Packer, built from github, in your $PATH.
        </li>
        <li>
          Terraform, built from github, in your $PATH.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jsonnet, built from github (this is also where you find the configuration and source
          code).
        </li>
        <li>
          An account on Google Cloud Platform (hosting the application will incur charges).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once those are satisfied, follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the Google Cloud Platform console, open your project, go to APIs and Auth /
          credentials, and create a new service account.  This will automatic download a p12 key,
          which you can delete as we will not be using it.  Instead, click the button to download a
          JSON key for the new service account, move it to the fractal directory, and call it
          <tt>service_account_key.json</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a credentials.jsonnet file based on the template, fill in your GCP project name and
          make up some unique passwords.
        </li>
      </ol>

        To deploy the application, run make -j.  This should start running 3 Packer builds in
        parallel.  In a separate terminal, use tail -f *.log in order to watch their progress.  When
        the images are built, Terraform will show you the proposed changes (a long list of resources
        to be created).  Enter <tt>y</tt> to confirm the changes.  In time, the application will be
        deployed.  Now you only need the appserv ip address to connect to it.  You can get this
        using "gcloud compute addresses list" or by navigating the Google Cloud Platform console to
        "networks".  Opening that ip in a web browser should take you to the fractal application
        itself.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The application can be brought down again by running <tt>terraform destroy</tt>.  Terraform
        remembers the resources it created via the <tt>terraform.tfstate</tt> file.  This will not
        destroy the Packer images; they can be deleted from the console or from gcloud.
      </p>

        Managing a production web service usually means making continual changes to it instead of
        bringing the whole thing down and up again, as we will shortly discuss.  However it is still
        useful to bring up a fresh application for testing / development purposes.  A copy or
        variant of the production service can be brought up concurrently with the production service
        (e.g., in a different project).  This can be useful for QA, automatic integration testing,
        or load testing.  It is also useful for training new ops staff or rehearsing a complex
        production change in a safe environment.

        Managing the Cassandra cluster requires a combination of configuration alteration (to
        control the fundamental compute resources) and use of the Cassandra command line tool
        "nodetool" on the instances themselves.  For example "nodetool status fractal" on any
        Cassandra instance will give information about the whole cluster.
      </p>
      <p>
        To add a new node (expand the cluster), simply edit <a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet"><code>service.jsonnet</code></a>, add another
        instance in the Terraform configuration and run make -j.  Confirm the changes (the only
        change should be the new instance, e.g., db4).  It will start up and soon become part of the
        cluster.
      </p>
      <p>
        To remove a node, first decommission it using nodetool -h HOSTNAME decommission.  When that
        is complete, destroy the actual instance by updating <a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet"><code>service.jsonnet</code></a> to remove the
        resource and run make -j again.  Confirm the removal of the instance.  It is OK to remove
        the first node, but its replacement should use <tt>GcpTopUpMixin</tt> instead of
        <tt>GcpStarterMixin</tt>.  You can recycle all of the nodes if you do it one at a time,
        which is actually necessary for emergency kernel upgrades.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a node is permanently and unexpectedly lost (e.g., a disk error), or you removed it
        without first decommissioning it, the cluster will remain in a state where it expects the
        dead node to return at some point (as if it were temporarily powered down or on the wrong
        side of a network split).  This situation can be rectified with nodetool removenode UUID,
        run from any other node in the cluster.  In this case it is probably also necessary to run
        nodetool repair on the other nodes to ensure data is properly distributed.

      <h3 id=using_appserv>Canary A Change To The Application Server</h3>

        To introduce new functionality to the application server it is useful to divert a small
        proportion of user traffic to the new code to ensure it is working properly.  After this
        initial "canary" test has passed, the remaining traffic can then be confidently transferred
        to the new code.  The same can be said for the tile generation service (e.g. to update the
        C++ code).
      </p>
      <p>
        The model used by this example is that the application server logic and static content are
        embedded in the application server image.  Canarying consists of building a new image and
        then rolling it out gradually one instance at a time.  Each step of this methodology
        consists of a small modification to <a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet"><code>service.jsonnet</code></a> and then running make -j.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Edit the <tt>appserv.packer.json</tt> packer configuration in <a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet"><code>service.jsonnet</code></a> to update the date embedded in
          the <tt>name</tt> field to the current date, and also make any desired changes to the
          configuration of the image or any of the referenced Python / HTML / CSS files.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run make -j to build the new image.  Note that the previous image is still available under
          the old name, which means it is possible to create new instances using either the old or
          new image.  This feature is essential to allow ongoing maintenance of the cluster if the
          change is rolled back.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a single instance with the new image by adding it to the
          <tt>google_compute_instance</tt> section of <a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet"><code>service.jsonnet</code></a> .  The easiest way to do this is to copy-paste the
          existing definition, and modify the image name in the copy to reflect the new image.  This
          allows easily rolling back by deleting the copied code, and you can also transition the
          rest of the nodes by deleting the original copy.  Thus, the duplication is only temporary.
          At this point the configuration may look like this:

          <pre class="medium">google_compute_instance: {

    ["appserv" + k]: resource.FractalInstance(k) {
        name: "appserv" + k,
        image: "appserv-v20141222-0300",
        ...
    }
    for k in [1, 2, 3]

} + {

    ["appserv" + k]: resource.FractalInstance(k) {
        name: "appserv" + k,
        image: "appserv-v20150102-1200",
        ...
    }
    for k in [4]

} + ...</pre>
          Also modify the appserv target pool to add the new instance 4, thus ensuring it receives
          traffic.
          <pre class="medium">appserv: {
      name: "appserv",
      health_checks: ["${google_compute_http_health_check.fractal.name}"],
      instances: [ "%s/appserv%d" % [zone(k), k] for k in [1, 2, 3, 4] ],
  }, </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Run make -j to effect those changes, and monitor the situation to ensure that there is no
          spike in errors.  It is also possible to run make -j between the above two steps if it is
          desired to interact with the new instance before directing user traffic at it.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is a problem, pull 4 out of the target pool and re-run make -j.  That will leave
          the instance up (useful for investigation) but it will no-longer receive user traffic.
          Otherwise, add more instances (5, 6, ...) and add them to the target pool.  You can now
          start pulling the old instances out of the target pool ensuring that there is always
          sufficient capacity for your traffic load.  As always, make -j punctuates the steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the old instances are drained of user traffic, they can be destroyed.  You can do
          this in batches or one at a time.  Eventually, the configuration will look like this, at
          which point the first block no-longer contributes anything to the configuration and it can
          be deleted:
          <pre class="medium">google_compute_instance: {

    ["appserv" + k]: resource.FractalInstance(k) {
        name: "appserv" + k,
        image: "appserv-v20141222-0300",
        ...
    }
    for k in []

} + {

    ["appserv" + k]: resource.FractalInstance(k) {
        name: "appserv" + k,
        image: "appserv-v20150102-1200",
        ...
    }
    for k in [4, 5, 6]

} + ... </pre>
        </li>

        We have shown how Jsonnet can be used to centralize, unify, and manage configuration for a
        realistic cloud application.  We have demonstrated how programming language abstraction
        techniques make the configuration very concise, with re-usable elements separated into
        template libraries.  Complexity is controlled in spite of the variety of different
        configurations, formats, and tasks involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally we demonstrated how with a little procedural glue to drive other processes (the
        humble UNIX make), we were able to build an operations methodology where many aspects of the
        service can be controlled centrally by editing a single Jsonnet file and issuing make -j
        update commands.
