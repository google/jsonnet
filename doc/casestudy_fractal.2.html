Case Study: Fractal Cloud Application

</h1>

<h2 id=config>Configuration Structure</h2>

<p>In this section we describe the ways in which Jsonnet aids with the configuration of the Fractal
application.  These are the three main productivity benefits when using Jsonnet:</p>

<ul>

<li>Centralization:  Bringing all configuration into the same place, where it can be maintained as a
single entity in a uniform format.  This allows maintaining the application as an application and
not as a disparate set of components.</li>

<li>Error avoidance:  Values that must be synchronized between different parts of the configuration
can be factored out to a single variable, so that they are easy to maintain and never go out of
sync.  For example the Tile Generation Service contains an Nginx configuration to listen on a
particular port, but that port must also be open in the firewall configuration, and known to the
clients that need to connect to it.  Specifying this port only once makes it a lot easier to avoid
errors when changing the port later on.</li>

<li>Brevity:  Given a large number of similar definitions, Jsonnet's object model allows abstracting
the common parts into templates that can be instantiated very concisely.  For example all cloud
instances have some common configuration, and the two HTTP services are also very similar.  Each
instantiation of a template can override specific details in order to express how it deviates from
the norm.  The net result is a reduction in the line count as well as making those critical
differences between definitions more clear and not lost in a sea of repeated data.</li>

</ul>

<p>The configuration is logically separated into several files via <code>import</code> constructs.
This is to promote abstraction and re-usability (some of our templates could be used by other
applications, so are separated into libraries), as well as having a separate credentials file (to
avoid accidental checkin).  Note that Jsonnet did not mandate this file structure; other separations
(or a giant single file) would also have been possible.</p>

<p>When the imports are realized, the result is a single configuration which yields a JSON packer
configuration for each image (*.packer.json) and the JSON Terraform configuration (terraform.tf),
using <a href="commandline.html#multi">multiple file output</a>.  Those configurations in turn embed
other configurations for the application software that will run on the instances.  The top-level
structure of the generated configuration is therefore as follows (with the content of each file
elided for clarity).</p>

<pre class="medium"><code>{
    "appserv.packer.json": ...,
    "cassandra.packer.json": ...,
    "tilegen.packer.json": ...,
    "terraform.tf": ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The configuration is built from the following input files:</p>











<ul>

<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet">service.jsonnet</a></tt>: The top level file that imports the others.  This is the filename that
is given to the jsonnet command line utility.  In it are all the details that define the Fractal
example application, as a list of packer images and a Terraform configuration that creates cloud
instances using those images.  Note the first few lines import the other Jsonnet files and store
their contents in top-level scoped variables (of the same names).  When we access definitions from
those libraries (e.g.  templates to override) we do so through the top-level variables.</li>

<li><tt>credentials.jsonnet</tt>: User and superuser keys for Cassandra, and Google Cloud Platform
project name.  You must create this file yourself, based on this <a
href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/credentials.jsonnet.TEMPLATE">sample file</a>.</li>

<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/packer.jsonnet">lib/packer.jsonnet</a></tt>: Some templates to help with writing Packer configurations.</li>

<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/terraform.jsonnet">lib/terraform.jsonnet</a></tt>: Some templates to help with writing Terraform
configurations.</li>

<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/cassandra.jsonnet">lib/cassandra.jsonnet</a></tt>: Some templates to help with writing Packer and Terraform
configurations for Cassandra.</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that the Jsonnet template libraries also include some definitions not used in this
example application, e.g.,  PostgreSQL and MySQL templates.  Those can be ignored.</p>

<p>To integrate Jsonnet with Packer and Terraform, a <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/Makefile">Makefile</a></tt> is used.  This first runs
Jsonnet on the configuration and then runs Packer / Terraform on the resulting files (if they have
changed).  The choice of 'glue' tool is arbitrary, we could also have used a small Python script.
We chose <tt>make</tt> because it is well understood, available everywhere, and does three things
that we want: Invoke other programs, run things in parallel, and avoid repeating work that is
already complete.  For example, Packer is only invoked if its configuration file has changed, and
the three image builds will proceed in parallel (they take a few minutes each).</p>

<p>Ignoring the re-usable templates, whitespace, and comments, the Jsonnet configuration is 217
lines (9.7kB).  The generated Packer and Terraform files are 740 lines (25kB) in total.  This
demonstrates the productivity benefits of using template expansion when writing configurations.</p>


<h3 id=config_whirlwind>Whirlwind Tour</h3>

<p> The fractal example is a complete realistic application and therefore its configuration has many
technical details.  In particular, it embeds configurations for various pieces of off-the-shelf
software that we don't want to go into in much depth.  However we would like to draw attention to
some particular uses of Jsonnet within the configuration.  We'll gladly field specific questions on
the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jsonnet">mailing list</a>.</p>


<h4>Packer And Application Configuration</h4>

<p>Each Packer configuration is, at its core, a list of imperative actions to be performed in
sequence by a VM, after which the disk is frozen to create the desired image.  The actions are
called <i>provisioners</i>.  Jsonnet is used to simplify the provisioner list by eliminating
duplication and encouraging abstraction.  Generic templates for specific off-the-shelf software are
defined in re-usable libraries, which are then referenced from <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet">service.jsonnet</a></tt> and, as
needed, overridden with some fractal application details.  Generic provisioners are also provided
for easy installation of packages via package managers, creation of specific files / dirs, etc.</p>

<p>In addition, the <code>ImageMixin</code> object in <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet">service.jsonnet</a></tt> is used to factor out
common fractal-specific configuration from the three images.  Note that it is a variable, so will
not appear in the output.  Factored out image config includes the Google Cloud Platform project id
and filename of the service account key.  Since all the images are derived ultimately from the
<code>GcpDebian</code> image (in <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/packer.jsonnet">lib/packer.jsonnet</a></tt>), and this image includes <tt>apt</tt>
&amp; <tt>pip</tt> provisioners (discussed shortly), this is also a good place to ensure some basic
packages are installed on every image.</p>

<pre class="medium"><code>local ImageMixin = {
    project_id: credentials.project,
    account_file: "service_account_key.json",

    // For debugging:
    local network_debug = ["traceroute", "lsof", "iptraf", "tcpdump", "host", "dnsutils"],
    aptPackages +: ["vim", "git", "psmisc", "screen", "strace" ] + network_debug,
},
</code></pre>

<p>Both the application server's image configuration <tt>appserv.packer.json</tt> and the tile
generation service's image configuration <tt>tilegen.packer.json</tt> extend
<code>MyFlaskImage</code>, which exists merely to add the aforementioned <code>ImageMixin</code> to
the <code>GcpDebianNginxUwsgiFlaskImage</code> template from <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/packer.jsonnet">lib/packer.jsonnet</a></tt>.  That template
builds on the basic <code>GcpDebianImage</code> template from the same library, and adds all the
packages (and default configuration) for both Nginx and uWSGI:</p>

<pre class="medium"><code>local MyFlaskImage = packer.GcpDebianNginxUwsgiFlaskImage + ImageMixin,
</code></pre>

<p>In Jsonnet we use JSON as the canonical data model and convert to other formats as needed.  An
example of this is the uWSGI configuration, an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI</a> file, which is specified in Jsonnet under the
<code>uwsgiConf</code> field in <code>GcpDebianNginxUwsgiFlaskImage</code>.  The JSON version is
converted to INI by the call to <code>std.manifestIni</code> (documented <a
href="stdlib.html">here</a>) in the provisioner immediately below it.  Representing the INI file
with the JSON object model (instead of as a string) allows elements of the uWSGI configuration (such
as the filename of the UNIX domain socket) to be easily kept in sync with other elements of the
configuration (Nginx also needs to know it).  If the application is configured with JSON, or even
YAML, then no conversion is required.  An example of that is the default Cassandra configuration
file held in the <code>conf</code> field of <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/cassandra.jsonnet">lib/cassandra.jsonnet</a></tt>.</p>

<p>Looking back at <tt>appserv.packer.json</tt> and <tt>tilegen.packer.json</tt> in
<tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet">service.jsonnet</a></tt>, while both use Nginx/uWSGI/Flask there are some subtle differences.  Since
the HTTP request handlers are different in each case, the module (uWSGI entrypoint) and also
required packages are different.  Firstly, the tile generation image needs a provisioner to build
the C++ code.  Secondly, since the application server talks to the Cassandra database using
cassandra-driver, which interferes with pre-forking, it is necessary to override the
<code>lazy</code> field of the uWSGI configuration in that image.  This is an example of how an
abstract template can unify two similar parts of the configuration, while still allowing the
overriding of small details as needed.  Note also that such precise manipulation of configuration
details would be much harder if the uWSGI configuration was represented as a single string instead
of as a structure within the object model.</p>

<pre class="medium"><code>"appserv.packer.json": MyFlaskImage {
    name: "appserv-v20141222-0300",
    module: "main",   // Entrypoint in the Python code.
    pipPackages +: ["httplib2", "cassandra-driver", "blist"],
    uwsgiConf +: { lazy: "true" },  // cassandra-driver does not survive fork()
    ...
},
</code></pre>

<p>Going up to the top of the template hierarchy we have <code>GcpDebianImage</code> and finally
<code>GcpImage</code> in <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/packer.jsonnet">lib/packer.jsonnet</a></tt>.  The latter gives the Packer builder configuration
for Google Cloud Platform, bringing out some fields to the top level (essentially hiding the
<code>builder</code> sub-object).  We can hide the builder configuration because we only ever need
one builder per image.  We can support multiple cloud providers by deriving an entire new Packer
configuration at the top level, overriding as necessary to specialize for that platform.  The
<code>GcpDebianImage</code> selects the base image (Backports) and adds provisioners for apt and pip
packages.  The configuration of those provisioners (the list of installed packages, and additional
repositories / keys) is brought out to the top level of the image configuration.  By default, the
lists are empty but sub-objects can override and extend them as we saw with
<tt>appserv.packer.json</tt>.</p>

<p>The actual provisioners <code>Apt</code> and <code>Pip</code> are defined further up
<tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/packer.jsonnet">lib/packer.jsonnet</a></tt>.  In their definitions, one can see how the various shell commands are built
up from the declarative lists of repositories, package names, etc.  Installing packages in a
non-interactive context requires a few extra switches and an environment variable, but the
<code>Apt</code> provisioner handles all that.  Also note how these provisioners both derive from
<code>RootShell</code> (defined right at the top of the file) because those commands need to be run
as root.</p>

<p>Note that everything discussed has been plain Jsonnet code.  It is possible to create your own
provisioners (based on these or from scratch) in order to declaratively control packer
in new ways.</p>


<h4>Terraform</h4>

<p>The remainder of <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet">service.jsonnet</a></tt> generates the Terraform configuration that defines all
the cloud resources that are required to run the fractal web application.  That includes the
instances that actually run the Packer images.  It also includes the resources that configure
network routing / firewalls, load balancers, etc.</p>

<p>Terraform accepts two basic syntaxes, JSON and <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl">HCL</a>
(a more concise form of JSON).  This provides a data structure that specifies the resources
required, but the model also has a few computational features:  Firstly, the structure has
'variables' which can be resolved by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation">string interpolation</a> within the
resources.  Also, all resources are also extended with a <tt>count</tt> parameter for creating
<i>n</i> replicas of that resource, and finally there is some support for importing 'modules', i.e.,
another Terraform configuration of resources (perhaps written by a third party).</p>

<p>The interpolation feature is not just for variables, it is also used to reference attributes of
resources that are not known until after deployment (i.e., cannot be known during Jsonnet execution
time).  For example, the generated IP address of a static IP resource called <tt>foo</tt> can be
referenced from a string in the definition of a resource <tt>bar</tt> using the syntax
<tt>${google_compute_address.foo.address}</tt>, which is resolved after the deployment of
<tt>foo</tt> in time for the deployment of <tt>bar</tt>.</p>

<p>We choose to emit JSON instead of HCL, as the latter would require conversion code.  We also do
not make use of any of the Terraform language features, as Jsonnet provides similar or greater
capabilities in each of those domains, and doing it at the Jsonnet level allows integration with the
rest of the configuration.  We do, however, use Terraform interpolation syntax for resolving the
"not known until deployment" attributes,  e.g., in order to configure the application server
with the host:port endpoint of the tile processing service.  Such resolution cannot be performed by
Jsonnet.</p>

<p>Going through <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet">service.jsonnet</a></tt>, the function <code>zone</code> is used to statically
assign <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/zones">zones</a> to instances on a round robin
basis.  All the instances extend from <code>FractalInstance</code>, which is parameterized by the
index <code>zone_hash</code> (it's actually just a function that takes zone_hash and returns an
instance template).  It is this index that is used to compute the zone, as can be seen in the body
of <code>FractalInstance</code>.  The zone is also also a namespace for the instance name, so when
we list the instances behind each load balancer in the <code>google_compute_target_pool</code>
object, we compute the zone for each instance there as well.</p>

<pre class="medium"><code>local zone(hash) =
    local arr = [
        "us-central1-a",
        "us-central1-b",
        "us-central1-f",
    ];
    arr[hash % std.length(arr)],
</code></pre>


<p><code>FractalInstance</code> also specifies some default API access scopes and tags, as well as
the network over which the instances communicate.  It extends <code>GcpInstance</code> from
<tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/terraform.jsonnet">lib/terraform.jsonnet</a></tt>, which brings default service account scopes, the network, and the
startup script to the top level, and provides some defaults for other parameters.</p>

<p>Back in <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet">service.jsonnet</a></tt> we now have the instance definitions themselves.  These are
arranged by image into clusters: application server, db (Cassandra), and tile generation.  Terraform
expects the instances in the form of a key/value map (i.e. a JSON object), since it identifies them
internally with unique string names.  Thus the three clusters are each expressed as an object, and
they are joined with the object addition <code>+</code> operator.</p>

<pre class="medium"><code>google_compute_instance: {
    ["appserv" + k]: ...
    for k in [1, 2, 3]
} + {
    db1: ...,
    db2: ...,
    db3: ...,
} + {
    ["tilegen" + k]: ...
    for k in [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <tt>appserv</tt> and <tt>tilegen</tt> replicas are given using an <a
href="tutorial.html#comprehension">object comprehension</a> in which the field name and value are
computed with <code>k</code> set to each index in the given list.  The variable <code>k</code> also
ends up as an argument to <code>FractalInstance</code> and thus defines the zone of the instance.
In both cases, we also place a file <tt>/var/www/conf.json</tt>.  This is read on the instance by
the application, at startup, and used to configure the service.  In the tilegen replicas the
configuration comes from <code>ApplicationConf</code> from the top of <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/fractal/service.jsonnet">service.jsonnet</a></tt>.  In
the appserv instances, the same data is used, but extended with some extra fields.</p>

<pre class="medium"><code>resource.FractalInstance(k) {
    ...
    conf:: ApplicationConf {
        database_name: cassandraKeyspace,
        database_user: cassandraUser,
        database_pass: credentials.cassandraUserPass,
        tilegen: "${google_compute_address.tilegen.address}",
        db_endpoints: cassandraNodes,
    },
    startup_script +: [self.addFile(self.conf, "/var/www/conf.json")],
}
</code></pre>

<p>In both cases, the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript">startup
script</a> has added an extra line appended, computed by <code>self.addFile()</code>, a method
inherited from <code>GcpInstance</code> in <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/terraform.jsonnet">lib/terraform.jsonnet</a></tt>.  Examining its definition
shows that it generates a line of bash to actually add the file:  </p>

<pre class="medium"><code>addFile(v, dest)::
    "echo %s > %s" % [std.escapeStringBash(v), std.escapeStringBash(dest)],
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, the Cassandra cluster is deployed via an explicit list of three nodes (db1, db2, db3).
We attend to them individually, firstly because bringing up a Cassandra cluster from scratch
requires one node to have a special boot strapping role, and secondly because database nodes are
stateful and therefore less 'expendable' than application or tile server nodes.  All three nodes
extend from the <code>CassandraInstance(i)</code> mixin, which is where they get their common
configuration.  As with <code>FractalInstance(i)</code>, the integer parameter is used to drive the
zone.  The bootstrap behavior of the first node is enabled by extending <code>GcpStarterMixin</code>
instead of <code>GcpTopUpMixin</code>.  The starter mixin has extra logic to initialize the
database, which we pass in the form of a <a
href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql/CQL.html">CQL</a> script to create the database and
replication factor for one of its internal tables.  There is some fancy footwork required to get
Cassandra into a stable state without exposing it to the network in a passwordless state.  All of
that is thankfully hidden behind the two re-usable mixins in <tt><a href="https://github.com/google/jsonnet/blob/master/case_studies/lib/cassandra.jsonnet">lib/cassandra.jsonnet</a></tt>.</p>
